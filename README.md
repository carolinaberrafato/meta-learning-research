# Entropy as an indication of Instance Hardness
This is a research project (Iniciação Científica) under development from July 2023 and it's still being updated.

The experiments investigate the impact of data entropy in the classification of inherently hard-to-classify instances. This is done through meta-learning models created to predict the error of a pool of 10 classification algorithms:

1. kNN
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Naive Bayes
5. Logistic Regression
6. SVM Classifier
7. MLP Classifier
8. XG Boost (Gradient Boosting)
9. Cat Boost (Gradient Boosting)
10. SVM Classifier with Linear Kernel

## Running the Project

1. Download the dataset in the directory "Dataset"
2. Create in your Google Drive in /MyDrive a folder called "Datasets" and add the .csv in it
3. Open the notebook in Google Colab and run
